# **Diabetic Retinopathy Classification using AI**

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to develop an **AI model** for **classifying retinal images** to detect **diabetic retinopathy**.  
The classification is based on images from a **fundus camera** and **fluorescein angiography**.  

The model will automatically identify the disease progression in one of five stages:  
- ✅ **No diabetic retinopathy**  
- ✅ **Mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy**  
- ✅ **Moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy**  
- ✅ **Severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy**  
- ✅ **Proliferative diabetic retinopathy**  



## 🛠 Technologies  
- **Language:** Python 🐍  
- **Libraries:** *(to be determined during development)*  
- **Interface:** Desktop 🖥️  



## 🤖 AI Model Selection & Implementation  
For image classification, **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** will be utilized, including:  
-  *(to be determined during development)*
